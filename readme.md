### Its main purpose
...To fix the problems you never should have known about

some examples:

<pre>
Name clashes?
        <i>No?</i>
        <i>Each definition is unique all around the üåè</i>
But either way, snakecase or PascalCase? 
        <i>s p a c e s</i>
        <i>By the way, your names can contain anything.</i>
        <i>want this: " or maybe a üå≤?</i>
Tabs or spaces? 
        <i>How about none of those?</i>
I keep misspelling my names :(
        <i>Don't worry, you can't even use things that aren't defined</i>
But there must be at least some compile time errors.
        <i>Only 1 instantly at compile time.</i>
        <i>"missing arguments"</i>
Not bad, I want to experience the rest myself!
